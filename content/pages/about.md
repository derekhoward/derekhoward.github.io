Title: About


I created this site to document and share some of my learning process. In the past, I've found various blogposts to be interesting and helpful in solving a wide range of problems. As I've developed my abilities, I've learned that it's best to build off of what others have already done and have grown to appreciate the power of open source tools. Hopefully some posts here can serve as a jumping off point for others who are trying to solve similar problems.


### About Me

I am a scientist by training with a background mainly in cellular/molecular neuroscience. I went down a more computational path after first attending a Software Carpentry workshop and I have learned enough that I can now help contribute by teaching others who are starting off in scientific computing and analysis.
