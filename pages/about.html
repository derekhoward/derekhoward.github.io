            <h3>About this website</h3>
<p>I created this site to document and share some of my learning process. One thing I have learned as I've developed my analytical and programming abilities s that it's best to build off of what others have already done. In the past, I've found various blogposts to be interesting and helpful in solving a wide range of problems. Hopefully some posts here can serve as useful examples for others who are trying to solve similar problems.</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am a scientist by training with a background mainly in cellular/molecular neuroscience. I initially started off down this path after attending a Software Carpentry workshop and I have learned enough that I can now help contribute by teaching others who are starting off in scientific computing. I started off writing small scripts for scientific research and have grown to appreciate the power of open source tools.</p>
